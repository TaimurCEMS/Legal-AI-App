Cleanup: remove legacy api function; lock Slice 0 foundation

This commit completes the cleanup and hardening pass for Slice 0 without
modifying business logic or breaking tests.

## Code Cleanup

- Verified no legacy "api" function exists in codebase
- Confirmed clean exports: index.ts only exports 3 Slice 0 callable functions
  - orgCreate
  - orgJoin
  - memberGetMyMembership
- Fixed linting errors in test file:
  - Replaced require() with fs.readFileSync + JSON.parse
  - Removed unused error variables (2 instances)
- Repository structure verified clean (no Express routes, no unused code)

## Deployment Cleanup

- Deleted legacy "api" function from Firebase (v2, https trigger)
- Verified only Slice 0 functions remain deployed:
  - orgCreate (v1, callable)
  - orgJoin (v1, callable)
  - memberGetMyMembership (v1, callable)

## Documentation

- Added SLICE_STATUS.md: Comprehensive slice status and testing guide
- Updated functions/README.md: Added LOCKED status and test instructions
- Added CLEANUP_REPORT.md: Full cleanup report with verification results

## Verification

- ✅ Lint: Passing (all errors fixed)
- ✅ Build: Passing
- ✅ Tests: All passing (3/3)
- ✅ Deployment: Clean (only Slice 0 functions)
